stral Voyaging and Karma
The Hindus refer to astral bodies as "light bodies." There is only a certain
amount of learning the soul can do on the astral plane. It must travel to
other planes (causal, mental, etheric, and the soul plane) to acquire
advanced levels of instruction (see chapter 5). Each dimension or plane
has spirit guides instructing your soul. Naturally, your Higher Self is pre-
sent with you during this process.
Dual consciousness is the term applied to being aware of the astral
body, or other dimensional body, and the physical body at the same time.
This may appear confusing at first, but this division of consciousness is
in no way harmful. No astral voyage technique will endanger you. The
only issue is how much benefit you can obtain with the least amount of
discomfort (rigidity or paralysis), and how fast this will occur.
There is absolutely nothing to fear about out-of-body experiences.
You will always be both protected and assisted by your Higher Self (espe-
cially if you follow the scripts in this book or use my tapes). Eventually
2 Robert Crookall, The Study and Practice of Astral Projection (London: Aquarian Press, 1961).6 • Chapter 1
your astral body will return to your physical body, with perhaps just a
light jolt.
The purpose of these nightly excursions into other dimensions is to
encourage the spiritual growth of the soul so that we may eliminate our
karma and the need to reincarnate. There are four types of karma. Fate
karma is the first type, consisting of the actions from previous lifetimes
resulting in our present circumstances.
The second type of karma is primal karma. The original creative force
(God) somehow removed our soul from the thirteenth plane and placed
it in the lower five planes, so that we are required to purify ourselves by
our own initiative and efforts in order to rejoin this perfect energy
source. The reason for this is speculative. Was it some form of original
sin? Could this have been the result of perfect energy beings somehow
violating natural laws and being trapped in the physical body as punish-
ment? Your guess is as good as mine.
Reserve karma is the third type. This category places us at the mercy
of the Lords of Karma, and states that we are assigned a certain amount
of karma at their discretion. We supposedly have no input about this
decision. I have always rejected this concept, due to the lack of partici-
pation of our free will.
Last, there is daily karma. This comprises the karma we incur or elim-
inate from our day-to-day actions and intentions.
An Astral Voyage in History
Charles Lindbergh's 1927 transatlantic flight made aviation history, but
it was for him memorable for an additional experience. During the
twenty-second hour of his flight across the Atlantic, battling extreme
fatigue, Lindbergh left his physical body. In his book Autobiography of
Values he stated:
I existed independently of time and matter. I felt myself
departing from my body as I imagine a spirit would
depart—emanating into the cockpit, extending through the
fuselage as though no frame or fabric walls were there, angling
upward, outward, until I reformed in an awareness far distantAstral Projection • 7
from the human form I left. . . . 7 remained connected to my
body through a long-extended strand, a strand so tenuous that
it could have been severed by a breath?
The Ancient Greeks
Plato wrote about near-death experiences and conscious dying in Book
X of The Republic. Plato also described astral voyaging in his Phaedo,
when he related the details of the last hours of Socrates. Socrates states,
And what is the purification but the separation of Soul from the
body, as I was saying before; the habit of Soul gathering and col-
lecting herself into herself, out of all the courses of the body; the
dwelling in her own place alone, as in another place alone, as in
another life, so also in this, as far as she can; the release of Soul
from the chains of the body?4
Pythagoras, the Greek adept and mathematician of the fifth century
B.c., was able to utilize soul travel at any time. Alexander the Great used
soul travel, while victorious at the battles of Gaugamela, Hydaspes, and
Issus. However, neither of these great generals succeeded in the end.
Napoleon was forced into exile and Alexander died at a young age.
Roman Senator Curma
During the fifth century A.D., Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in Numidia,
North Africa, described the astral voyaging of the Roman Curma. When
Curma was seriously ill he had a near-death experience in which spirits
on the astral plane informed him that a goldsmith had just died near his
(Curma's) home.
Senator Curma reported that the astral plane contained souls of both
"dead" people and those still functioning on the physical plan, a com-
mon sight in the astral world. Upon awakening from this state, Curma
ordered a messenger to his home region. This messenger returned with
confirmation that the local goldsmith had recently died.

4 Plato, Phaedo, translated by R. Hackforth (London: Cambridge University Press, 1955).8 • Chapter 1
Zoroaster
Zoroaster, or Zarathustra, was the founder of the ancient Persian reli-
gion bearing his name. He mastered soul travel and visited the third
plane. Later, Zoroaster was given the mission to reform the old religion
of pantheism and transform it to monotheism. He had many communi-
cations with his Masters and Guides that facilitated the downfall of
Persian idolatry.
Mohammed
Mohammed made similar journeys as Zoroaster, on a "white horse."
This prophet described the seven heavens he witnessed in the Koran.
Other Examples
Maria Corelli, author of Ardath, was a well-known occult novel writer
during the nineteenth century. Many of her books were based on her
astral voyaging.
Paramahansa Yogananda, in his Autobiography of a Yoga,5 describes
how, through soul travel, he was able to meet his former guru Sri
Yukesteswar, who was then deceased.
The Benefits of Astral Voyaging
We all have the natural ability to travel beyond our physical body into
other dimensions. Developing this skill can bring us wisdom, freedom,
and spiritual growth, and help us overcome the fear of death. Freedom
from all physical, mental, emotional, psychic, and spiritual entangle-
ments is usually the principal reason someone is attracted to soul travel.
Another advantage encountered in soul travel is the attainment of
wisdom and love. By transcending the physical body we are exposed to
and absorb this spiritual knowledge and behavior and bring them back
to the physical plane. This becomes part of our spiritual growth, regard-
less of our initial motives for astral voyaging.
One of our primary illusions on the material Earth plane is that out-
side factors control our lives. It is always our own consciousness that
5 Paramahansa Yogananda, Autobiography of a Yoga (Los Angeles: Self-Realization Pub., 1974).Astral Projection • 9
creates our reality. The new physics clearly establishes this. A thorough
discussion of this concept is presented in my book Soul Healing (St.
Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1996).
Since our consciousness creates our universe, a change in conscious-
ness is necessary in order to travel to the other dimensions. That is why
I present preliminary or preparatory exercises before the basic tech-
niques of astral voyaging.
The difference in our states of consciousness can be illustrated by
looking at an object. You may analyze it, compare it to other objects, and
even define it. These are mental or cognitive approaches. You can only
know an object or idea spiritually by becoming it.
This is much more than merely focusing your concentration. When
you narrow your awareness upon a single idea (soul travel) exclusively,
you also focus your attention on the feeling of this astral journey, so that
all other thoughts and distractions are blocked from your conscious-
ness. This will now bring about the out-of-body experience you so
desire, and a safe return to the physical body.
You can actually correct current problems by soul travel. For instance,
thought is a component of the mental plane, while imagination is char-
acteristic of the astral plane. By traveling to the appropriate plane, you
can use its respective mechanism to alter circumstances in your present
to a more pleasant outcome. Once you leave the physical body, there is
no time as we know it. Past, present, and future all mesh together pro-
viding an ideal opportunity to correct mistakes.
Please don't consider this some form of "cheating" the universe. The
karmic laws are perfectly just, and this knowledge would be unattainable
("forbidden knowledge") if it was out of line with the universe's plan.
Summarizing Astral Voyaging
Leaving the physical body may occur when we are healthy or ill. It takes
place every night when we sleep (particularly during our dream or REM
cycle), during physical or emotional trauma, and at times when we are
intensely focused or preoccupied with something.10 • Chapter 1

best thing I could have done. Within a few weeks I had won Edison's
confidence, and it came about in this way.
The S.S. Oregon, the fastest passenger steamer at that time, had both of
its lighting machines disabled and its sailing was delayed. As the
superstructure had been built after their installation, it was impossible
to remove them from the hold. The predicament was a serious one and
Edison was much annoyed. In the evening I took the necessary
instruments with me and went aboard the vessel where I stayed for the
night. The dynamos were in bad condition, having several short-circuits
and breaks, but with the assistance of the crew, I succeeded in putting
them in good shape. At five o'clock in the morning, when passing along
Fifth Avenue on my way to the shop, I met Edison with Bachelor and a
few others, as they were returning home to retire. "Here is our Parisian
running around at night," he said. When I told him that I was coming
from the Oregon and had repaired both machines, he looked at me in
silence and walked away without another word. But when he had gone
some distance I heard him remark, "Bachelor, this is a good man." And
from that time on I had full freedom in directing the work. For nearly a
year my regular hours were from 10:30 A.M. until 5 o'clock the next
morning without a day's exception. Edison said to me, "I have had many
hard working assistants, but you take the cake." During this period I
designed twenty-four different types of standard machines with short
cores and uniform pattern, which replaced the old ones. The manager
had promised me fifty thousand dollars on the completion of this task,
but it turned out to be a practical joke. This gave me a painful shock and
I resigned my position.
Immediately thereafter, some people approached me with the proposal
of forming an arc light company under my name, to which I agreed. Here
finally, was an opportunity to develop the motor, but when I broached
the subject to my new associates they said, "No, we want the arc lamp.
We don't care for this alternating current of yours." In 1886, my system
of arc lighting was perfected and adopted for factory and municipal
lighting, and I was free, but with no other possession than a beautifully
engraved certificate of stock of hypothetical value. Then followed a
period of struggle in the new medium for which I was not fitted, but the
reward came in the end, and in April, 1887, the Tesla Electric Co. was
organized, providing a laboratory and facilities. The motors I built there
were exactly as I had imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the
design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to my
vision and the operation was always as I expected.
In the early part of 1888, an arrangement was made with the
Westinghouse Company for the manufacture of the motors on a large
scale. But great difficulties had still to be overcome. My system was
based on the use of low frequency currents and the Westinghouse
experts had adopted 133 cycles with the objects of securing advantages
in transformation. They did not want to depart with their standard forms
of apparatus and my efforts had to be concentrated upon adapting the
motor to these conditions. Another necessity was to produce a motor

capable of running efficiently at this frequency on two wires, which was
not an easy accomplishment.
At the close of 1889, however, my services in Pittsburgh being no longer
essential, I returned to New York and resumed experimental work in a
Laboratory on Grand Street, where I began immediately the design of
high-frequency machines. The problems of construction in this
unexplored field were novel and quite peculiar, and I encountered many
difficulties. I rejected the inductor type, fearing that it might not yield
perfect sine waves, which were so important to resonant action. Had it
not been for this, I could have saved myself a great deal of labor.
Another discouraging feature of the high-frequency alternator seemed to
be the inconstancy of speed which threatened to impose serious
limitations to its use. I had already noted in my demonstrations before
the American Institution of Electrical Engineers, that several times the
tune was lost, necessitating readjustment, and did not yet foresee what
I discovered long afterwards, a means of operating a machine of this
kind at a speed constant to such a degree as not to vary more than a
small fraction of one revolution between the extremes of load. From
many other considerations, it appeared desirable to invent a simpler
device for the production of electric oscillations.
In 1856, Lord Kelvin had exposed the theory of the condenser discharge,
but no practical application of that important knowledge was made. I
saw the possibilities and undertook the development of induction
apparatus on this principle. My progress was so rapid as to enable me to
exhibit at my lecture in 1891 a coil giving sparks of five inches. On that
occasion I frankly told the engineers of a defect involved in the
transformation by the new method, namely, the loss in the spark gap.
Subsequent investigation showed that no matter what medium is
employed, be it air, hydrogen, mercury vapor, oil, or a stream of
electrons, the efficiency is the same. It is a law very much like the
governing of the conversion of mechanical energy. We may drop a
weight from a certain height vertically down, or carry it to the lower
level along any devious path; it is immaterial insofar as the amount of
work is concerned. Fortunately however, this drawback is not fatal, as
by proper proportioning of the resonant, circuits of an efficiency of 85
percent is attainable. Since my early announcement of the invention, it
has come into universal use and wrought a revolution in many
departments, but a still greater future awaits it.
When in 1900 I obtained powerful discharges of 1,000 feet and flashed a
current around the globe, I was reminded of the first tiny spark I
observed in my Grand Street laboratory and was thrilled by sensations
akin to those I felt when I discovered the rotating magnetic field.

The Influences That Shape Our Destiny

As I review the events of my past life I realize how subtle are the
influences that shape our destinies. An incident of my youth may serve
to illustrate. One winter's day I managed to climb a steep mountain, in
company with other boys. The snow was quite deep and a warm
southerly wind made it just suitable for our purpose. We amused
ourselves by throwing balls which would roll down a certain distance,
gathering more or less snow, and we tried to outdo one another in this
sport. Suddenly a ball was seen to go beyond the limit, swelling to
enormous proportions until it became as big as a house and plunged
thundering into the valley below with a force that made the ground
tremble. I looked on spellbound incapable of understanding what had
happened. For weeks afterward the picture of the avalanche was before
my eyes and I wondered how anything so small could grow to such an
immense size.
Ever since that time the magnification of feeble actions fascinated me,
and when, years later, I took up the experimental study of mechanical
and electrical resonance, I was keenly interested from the very start.
Possibly, had it not been for that early powerful impression I might not
have followed up the little spark I obtained with my coil and never
developed my best invention, the true history of which I will tell. Many
technical men, very able in their special departments, but dominated by
a pedantic spirit and nearsighted, have asserted that excepting the
induction motor, I have given the world little of practical use. This is a
grievous mistake. A new idea must not be judged by its immediate
results. My alternating system of power transmission came at a
psychological moment, as a long sought answer to pressing industrial
questions, and although considerable resistance had to be overcome and
opposing interests reconciled, as usual, the commercial introduction
could not be long delayed. Now, compare this situation with that
confronting my turbines, for example. One should think that so simple
My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla

Pg. 29

and beautiful an invention, possessing many features of an ideal motor,
should be adopted at once and, undoubtedly, it would under similar
conditions. But the prospective effect of the rotating field was not to
render worthless existing machinery; on the contrary, it was to give it
additional value. The system lent itself to new enterprise as well as to
improvement of the old. My turbine is an advance of a character entirely
different. It is a radical departure in the sense that its success would
mean the abandonment of the antiquated types of prime movers on
which billions of dollars have been spent. Under such circumstances, the
progress must needs be slow and perhaps the greatest impediment is
encountered in the prejudicial opinions created in the minds of experts
by organized opposition.
Only the other day, I had a disheartening experience when I met my
friend and former assistant, Charles F. Scott, now professor of Electric
Engineering at Yale. I had not seen him for a long time and was glad to
have an opportunity for a little chat at my office. Our conversation,
naturally enough, drifted on my turbine and I became heated to a high
degree. "Scott," I exclaimed, carried away by the vision of a glorious
future, "My turbine will scrap all the heat engines in the world." Scott
stroked his chin and looked away thoughtfully, as though making a
mental calculation. "That will make quite a pile of scrap," he said, and
left without another word.
These and other inventions of mine, however, were nothing more than
steps forward in a certain directions. In evolving them, I simply followed
the inborn instinct to improve the present devices without any special
thought of our far more imperative necessities. The "Magnifying
Transmitter" was the product of labours extending through years,
having for their chief object, the solution of problems which are
infinitely more important to mankind than mere industrial development.
If my memory serves me right, it was in November, 1890, that I
performed a laboratory experiment which was one of the most
extraordinary and spectacular ever recorded in the annals of Science. In
investigating the behavior of high frequency currents, I had satisfied
myself that an electric field of sufficient intensity could be produced in a
room to light up electrode less vacuum tubes. Accordingly, a transformer
was built to test the theory and the first trial proved a marvelous
success. It is difficult to appreciate what those strange phenomena
meant at the time. We crave for new sensations, but soon become
indifferent to them. The wonders of yesterday are today common
occurrences. When my tubes were first publicly exhibited, they were
viewed with amazement impossible to describe. From all parts of the
world, I received urgent invitations and numerous honors and other
flattering inducements were offered to me, which I declined. But in 1892
the demand became irresistible and I went to London where I delivered
a lecture before the institution of Electrical Engineers.
It has been my intention to leave immediately for Paris in compliance
with a similar obligation, but Sir James Dewar insisted on my appearing
before the Royal Institution. I was a man of firm resolve, but succumbed

nd machine learning techniques.
54 Go-playing
programs have been improving at a rate of about 1
dan/year in recent years. If this rate of improvement
continues, they might beat the human world champion
in about a decade.
There is an important sense, however, in which chess-playing AI turned out to be
a lesser triumph than many imagined it would be. It was once supposed, perhaps notunreasonably, that in order for a computer to play chess at grandmaster level, it
would have to be endowed with a high degree of general intelligence.
57 One might
have thought, for example, that great chess playing requires being able to learn
abstract concepts, think cleverly about strategy, compose flexible plans, make a
wide range of ingenious logical deductions, and maybe even model one’s opponent’s
thinking. Not so. It turned out to be possible to build a perfectly fine chess engine
around a special-purpose algorithm.
58 When implemented on the fast processors that
became available towards the end of the twentieth century, it produces very strong
play. But an AI built like that is narrow. It plays chess; it can do no other.
59
In other domains, solutions have turned out to be more complicated than initially
expected, and progress slower. The computer scientist Donald Knuth was struck that
“AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’
but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking’
—that,
somehow, is much harder!”60 Analyzing visual scenes, recognizing objects, or
controlling a robot’s behavior as it interacts with a natural environment has proved
challenging. Nevertheless, a fair amount of progress has been made and continues to
be made, aided by steady improvements in hardware.
Common sense and natural language understanding have also turned out to be
difficult. It is now often thought that achieving a fully human-level performance on
these tasks is an “AI-complete” problem, meaning that the difficulty of solving these
problems is essentially equivalent to the difficulty of building generally human-
level intelligent machines.
61 In other words, if somebody were to succeed in creating
an AI that could understand natural language as well as a human adult, they would in
all likelihood also either already have succeeded in creating an AI that could do
everything else that human intelligence can do, or they would be but a very short
step from such a general capability.
62
Chess-playing expertise turned out to be achievable by means of a surprisingly
simple algorithm. It is tempting to speculate that other capabilities—such as general
reasoning ability, or some key ability involved in programming—might likewise be
achievable through some surprisingly simple algorithm. The fact that the best
performance at one time is attained through a complicated mechanism does not
mean that no simple mechanism could do the job as well or better. It might simply
be that nobody has yet found the simpler alternative. The Ptolemaic system (with the
Earth in the center, orbited by the Sun, the Moon, planets, and stars) represented the
state of the art in astronomy for over a thousand years, and its predictive accuracy
was improved over the centuries by progressively complicating the model: adding
epicycles upon epicycles to the postulated celestial motions. Then the entire system
was overthrown by the heliocentric theory of Copernicus, which was simpler and—
though only after further elaboration by Kepler—more predictively accurate.
63
Artificial intelligence methods are now used in more areas than it would makesense to review here, but mentioning a sampling of them will give an idea of the
breadth of applications. Aside from the game AIs listed in Table 1, there are hearing
aids with algorithms that filter out ambient noise; route-finders that display maps
and offer navigation advice to drivers; recommender systems that suggest books and
music albums based on a user’s previous purchases and ratings; and medical
decision support systems that help doctors diagnose breast cancer, recommend
treatment plans, and aid in the interpretation of electrocardiograms. There are
robotic pets and cleaning robots, lawn-mowing robots, rescue robots, surgical robots,
and over a million industrial robots.
64 The world population of robots exceeds 10
million.
65
Modern speech recognition, based on statistical techniques such as hidden Markov
models, has become sufficiently accurate for practical use (some fragments of this
book were drafted with the help of a speech recognition program). Personal digital
assistants, such as Apple’s Siri, respond to spoken commands and can answer simple
questions and execute commands. Optical character recognition of handwritten and
typewritten text is routinely used in applications such as mail sorting and
digitization of old documents.
66
Machine translation remains imperfect but is good enough for many applications.
Early systems used the GOFAI approach of hand-coded grammars that had to be
developed by skilled linguists from the ground up for each language. Newer systems
use statistical machine learning techniques that automatically build statistical
models from observed usage patterns. The machine infers the parameters for these
models by analyzing bilingual corpora. This approach dispenses with linguists: the
programmers building these systems need not even speak the languages they are
working with.
67
Face recognition has improved sufficiently in recent years that it is now used at
automated border crossings in Europe and Australia. The US Department of State
operates a face recognition system with over 75 million photographs for visa
processing. Surveillance systems employ increasingly sophisticated AI and data-
mining technologies to analyze voice, video, or text, large quantities of which are
trawled from the world’s electronic communications media and stored in giant data
centers.
Theorem-proving and equation-solving are by now so well established that they
are hardly regarded as AI anymore. Equation solvers are included in scientific
computing programs such as Mathematica. Formal verification methods, including
automated theorem provers, are routinely used by chip manufacturers to verify the
behavior of circuit designs prior to production.
The US military and intelligence establishments have been leading the way to the
large-scale deployment of bomb-disposing robots, surveillance and attack drones,
and other unmanned vehicles. These still depend mainly on remote control by humanoperators, but work is underway to extend their autonomous capabilities.
Intelligent scheduling is a major area of success. The DART tool for automated
logistics planning and scheduling was used in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to
such effect that DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the
United States) claims that this single application more than paid back their thirty-
year investment in AI.
68 Airline reservation systems use sophisticated scheduling
and pricing systems. Businesses make wide use of AI techniques in inventory
control systems. They also use automatic telephone reservation systems and
helplines connected to speech recognition software to usher their hapless customers
through labyrinths of interlocking menu options.
AI technologies underlie many Internet services. Software polices the world’s
email traffic, and despite continual adaptation by spammers to circumvent the
countermeasures being brought against them, Bayesian spam filters have largely
managed to hold the spam tide at bay. Software using AI components is responsible
for automatically approving or declining credit card transactions, and continuously
monitors account activity for signs of fraudulent use. Information retrieval systems
also make extensive use of machine learning. The Google search engine is, arguably,
the greatest AI system that has yet been built.
Now, it must be stressed that the demarcation between artificial intelligence and
software in general is not sharp. Some of the applications listed above might be
viewed more as generic software applications rather than AI in particular—though
this brings us back to McCarthy’s dictum that when something works it is no longer
called AI. A more relevant distinction for our purposes is that between systems that
have a narrow range of cognitive capability (whether they be called “AI” or not) and
systems that have more generally applicable problem-solving capacities. Essentially
all the systems currently in use are of the former type: narrow. However, many of
them contain components that might also play a role in future artificial general
intelligence or be of service in its development—components such as classifiers,
search algorithms, planners, solvers, and representational frameworks.
One high-stakes and extremely competitive environment in which AI systems
operate today is the global financial market. Automated stock-trading systems are
widely used by major investing houses. While some of these are simply ways of
automating the execution of particular buy or sell orders issued by a human fund
manager, others pursue complicated trading strategies that adapt to changing market
conditions. Analytic systems use an assortment of data-mining techniques and time
series analysis to scan for patterns and trends in securities markets or to correlate
historical price movements with external variables such as keywords in news tickers.
Financial news providers sell newsfeeds that are specially formatted for use by such
AI programs. Other systems specialize in finding arbitrage opportunities within or
between markets, or in high-frequency trading that seeks to profit from minute pricemovements that occur over the course of milliseconds (a timescale at which
communication latencies even for speed-of-light signals in optical fiber cable
become significant, making it advantageous to locate computers near the exchange).
Algorithmic high-frequency traders account for more than half of equity shares
traded on US markets.
69 Algorithmic trading has been implicated in the 2010 Flash
Crash (see Box 2).
Box 2 The 2010 Flash Crash
By the afternoon of May, 6, 2010, US equity markets were already down 4% on
worries about the European debt crisis. At 2:32 p.m., a large seller (a mutual fund
complex) initiated a sell algorithm to dispose of a large number of the E-Mini S&P
500 futures contracts to be sold off at a sell rate linked to a measure of minute-to-
minute liquidity on the exchange. These contracts were bought by algorithmic high-
frequency traders, which were programmed to quickly eliminate their temporary
long positions by selling the contracts on to other traders. With demand from
fundamental buyers slacking, the algorithmic traders started to sell the E-Minis
primarily to other algorithmic traders, which in turn passed them on to other
algorithmic traders, creating a “hot potato” effect driving up trading volume—this
being interpreted by the sell algorithm as an indicator of high liquidity, prompting it
to increase the rate at which it was putting E-Mini contracts on the market, pushing
the downward spiral. At some point, the high-frequency traders started withdrawing
from the market, drying up liquidity while prices continued to fall. At 2:45 p.m.,
trading on the E-Mini was halted by an automatic circuit breaker, the exchange’s
stop logic functionality. When trading was restarted, a mere five seconds later,
prices stabilized and soon began to recover most of the losses. But for a while, at the
trough of the crisis, a trillion dollars had been wiped off the market, and spillover
effects had led to a substantial number of trades in individual securities being
executed at “absurd” prices, such as one cent or 100,000 dollars. After the market
closed for the day, representatives of the exchanges met with regulators and decided
to break all trades that had been executed at prices 60% or more away from their
pre-crisis levels (deeming such transactions “clearly erroneous” and thus subject to
post facto cancellation under existing trade rules).
70
The retelling here of this episode is a digression because the computer programs
involved in the Flash Crash were not particularly intelligent or sophisticated, and the
kind of threat they created is fundamentally different from the concerns we shall
raise later in this book in relation to the prospect of machine superintelligence.
Nevertheless, these events illustrate several useful lessons. One is the reminder thatinteractions between individually simple components (such as the sell algorithm and
the high-frequency algorithmic trading programs) can produce complicated and
unexpected effects. Systemic risk can build up in a system as new elements are
introduced, risks that are not obvious until after something goes wrong (and
sometimes not even then).
71
Another lesson is that smart professionals might give an instruction to a program
based on a sensible-seeming and normally sound assumption (e.g. that trading
volume is a good measure of market liquidity), and that this can produce
catastrophic results when the program continues to act on the instruction with iron-
clad logical consistency even in the unanticipated situation where the assumption
turns out to be invalid. The algorithm just does what it does; and unless it is a very
special kind of algorithm, it does not care that we clasp our heads and gasp in
dumbstruck horror at the absurd inappropriateness of its actions. This is a theme that
we will encounter again.
A third observation in relation to the Flash Crash is that while automation
contributed to the incident, it also contributed to its resolution. The pre-
preprogrammed stop order logic, which suspended trading when prices moved too
far out of whack, was set to execute automatically because it had been correctly
anticipated that the triggering events could happen on a timescale too swift for
humans to respond. The need for pre-installed and automatically executing safety
functionality—as opposed to reliance on runtime human supervision—again
foresh
